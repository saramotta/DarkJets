    "Tetarenko+2018 used the same geometry followed by Kaiser+2004, and actually models exactly the same feature (IRAS 19132+1035), but assumes f = 0.1 (hollow sphere instead of a simple sphere), so that the volume is almost idential to what we use. The density however is estimated from the molecular gas contained by the radio contunuum feature, and is therefore calculated as mass/volume. The density in this case is a factor of ~ 10 higher than in our case. Also, they use a shock velocity of 1 Km/s (from FWHM of SiO detection), vs the 23 Km/s we get from Kaiser+2004 (shock velocity equals the velocity of jet end into the ISM). So the jet power in their case is a factor of 10/(20)^3 ~ 0.00125 lower.\n",

    "Now, the problem is that in Tetarenko+2018 the jet power estimate is 8.4e+32 erg/s, which is over a factor 10^4 lower than what we get applying what described in their paper (~4e+36 erg/s). Not sure where this comes from. It could be due to the constant C1, which however should be around 1, or 2 at most. "

    "The size of the bubble carved by the jet from GRS 1915+105 is approximately 5 times larger than that near Cyg X-1, considering the inclination angle of the source (its orbital plane at least, assuming a jet perpendicular to the disc, which is not necessarily correct) to the line of sight.\n",
    "Assuming that the bow-shock emission is predominantly from Bremsstrahlung (which is not necessarily true), the time-averaged energy emission rate from GRS 1915+105 as inferred from the bow-shock emission is at least of the order 1E+39 erg/s, i.e. over two orders of magnitude larger than what we observe for Cyg X-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, the age of the shock is between 0.1 and 1 Myr. The bow shock clearly must have formed much earlier than the recent outuburst (which lasted only 30 years). If the bow shock started forming when the source first became active, then the system has only spent a short time accreting, which impplies that there might have not been time for the black hole to spin up significantly (the companion is a red giant star of mass 0.8 Msun). This may imply that either the black hole formed with a very high spin, or the current measurements of the spins are wrong. However, according to Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Han 2002 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.341..385P/abstract)  shows that the initial mass of the donor in GRS 1915+105 may have been as high as ∼6 MSun and the black hole may have accreted up to ∼4 MSun from its companion, being spun up significantly in the process."
