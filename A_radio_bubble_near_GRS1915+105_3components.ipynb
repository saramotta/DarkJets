    "# A bow shocks near GRS 1915+105\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is partly based off the calculations presented in Gallo et al. 2004 to interpret the bow shock observed in the vicinity of Cyg X-1. Calculations have been adapted to the case of GRS 1915+105, near which we identified a bow shock similar to (albeit much larger than) that seen close to Cyg X-1. \n",
    "Additions have been made based on Kaiser et al. 2004 (who aready modelled a structure near GRS 1915+105 observed in radio), but did not see any large-scale bow shock due to the limited sensitivity of the VLA images they used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this version of the notebook we make the (reasonable) assumption that the hydrogen emitting the bow shock radiation is fully ionized for the densities we are dealing with. Based on Saha's equation, with densities of the order 0.1-1000 particles per unit volume all hydrogen should be ionized at a temperature of ~ 1000K. In order to have a ionization fraction different from 1, the density has to be at least 1E+06, which is way higher than the average ISM density.  \n",
    "In this regard, our treatment differs from that followed by Gallo et al., who assumed a given ionization fraction. \n",
    "In the following we treat separately the three components of the jet-ISM interaction region near GRS 1915+105, following the formalism described in Kaiser et al. 2004. \n"

    "Based on Kaiser et al. 2004, the **emission connected with the jets from GRS 1915+105 is formed by three components:** **(i)** the **thermal Bremsstrahlung emission** corresponding to the blobbly brightest region near IRAS 19132. Note that now the flux density is a factor of 10 lower than in 1998 (6 vs 60 mJy); **(ii)** the **non-thermal, possibly syncrotron emission** form the \"hot spot\", i.e. an elongated feature north-west from the IRAS region; **(iii)** the **bow shock emission**, with an average flux density of 0.2 mJy,  which is assumed to also be non-thermal syncrotron emission with a putative spectral slope of -0.8. This last component was not seen in the old VLA data, but interestingly it was indeed predicted by Kaiser et al. 2004. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the properties of the jet, we will do as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) We derive the density of the shocked material in IRAS 19132, assuming that the gas is fully ionised and that the radiation is Bremsstrahlung for a minimum temperature of T ~ 10$^4$K. We model the IRAS region as a solid sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) We infer the pre-shock ISM density knowing that the it should be about a factor of 4 smaller than in the shocked region. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) We estimate the jet advancing velocity assuming that it equals the velocity of the bow shock in the ISM. From here we can estimate the jet age. \n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Finally, we estimate the jet energy transport rate using the density derived above, and the lobe aspect ratio measured from the MeerKAT image. \n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Assuming the density derived by Tetarenko et al. 2018 we also estimate the energy transferred to the IRAS 19132 region implied by a different value of the ISM density. \n"

    "A comment on the electron density. If, following Tetarenko et al. 2018, the density is instead estimated based on the molecular gas content of the feature, rather than based on the luminosity of the feature from Bremsstrahlung emission and the presumed temperature of the gas, the energy stransferred will be clearly different. \n",
    "Based on Tetarenko et al. 2018 the gas density is of the order $\\sim$10$^{-20}$ g/cm$^3$, which is a factor of 10$^3$ higher than in our case. The resulting minimum transferred energy is consequently larger than the value we predict above, i.e. L $\\sim$ 10$^{39}$ erg/s (Q$_{jet}$ goes linearly with the density). \n",
    "However, **this density requires a gas temperature of the order T ~ 7E+9 K if the emission is from Bremsstrahlung, which does not seem realistic**, since at temperatures of T ~ 10$^7$−10$^8$K (typical of the hot gas in Galaxy clusters) the radiative losses start to dominate.\n"

The emission from the lobes is easily detected in radio, and similar emission should emerge around the jets in microquasars. \n",

We neglect any energy losses of the relativistic electrons due to radiation processes. We can infer the minimum energy magnetic field B$_{min}$ using the equation given in section 1 (minimum energy condition), and compare it with the magnetic field density we obtained for the cylindrical feature near the IRAS source (see Section 2). \n",

    "We obtain a minimum energy magnetic field of **Bmin ~ 7e-6 G**, and a minimum energy **pressure is p$_{}$ = 1.6e-12 erg/cm$^3$**, which are close enough to the values we obtained for the cylindrical feature. \n",
    "Curiously, the flux density we measure from the MeerKAT image of the bow shock is consistent with the flux density \n",

    "**On the jet power** - The size of the bubble carved by the jet from GRS 1915+105 is approximately 5 times larger than that near Cyg X-1, considering the inclination angle of the source (its orbital plane at least, assuming a jet perpendicular to the disc, which is not necessarily correct) to the line of sight.\n",
    "Assuming that the emisison from IRAS 19132+1035 is predominantly from Bremsstrahlung (supported by the flat spectral index measured in the old data), we infer an electron density of the order 60 particles/cm$^3$, which is similar to what was found in the case of Cyg X-1 (it was approximately 25 in that case, although the ionization parameter adopted was 0.01 instead of 1, which changed a lot the jet power estimate). Since the jet transferred energy goes linearly with the electron density (which is basically the only free parameter), any assumption on the density directly impact the jet power. With the parameters assumed so far, the minimum jet power is 5.2e+36 ergs/s. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) If we used the same *ionization fraction* adopted by Gallo et al. 2005, then the elctron density would be 2 orders of magnitude higher, and the implied jet power would be **5.2e+38 ergs/s.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Tetarenko et al. 2018 used *H2 column density* maps to estimate the gas mass in the IRAS region, under the assumption that it the best representative of the gas interacting and being displaced by the jet. The resulting electron density is ~4000 particles/cm$^3$, which implies a jet power of **1.44e+39 ergs/s.** The problem in this case is that for this electron density, the temperature of the gas implied by the Bremsstrahlung emissivity is of the order 10$^{13}$K, which is unrealistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we trust our own treatmen, then the energy transferred by the jet into the ISM is not as large as it could have been, but it is approximately equal to the accretion power in quiescence for this source.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On the jet age** - Based on our treatment, the age of the shock is at most 1.1 Myr, which means that the bow shock clearly must have formed much earlier than the recent outuburst (which lasted only 30 years). If the bow shock started forming when the source first became active, then the system has only spent a short time accreting. This implies that there might have not been time for the black hole to spin up significantly (the companion is a red giant star of mass 0.8 Msun). Hence, either the black hole formed with a relatively high spin. Interestingly, the RPM yields a relativrly high spin for GRS 191+105, which would math this prediction. Furthermore, Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Han 2002 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.341..385P/abstract) show that the initial mass of the donor in GRS 1915+105 may have been as high as ∼6 MSun and the black hole may have accreted up to ∼4 MSun from its companion, being spun up significantly in the process, all in a relatively short period of time - of the order of a Myr - consistently with the age of the bow shock."
